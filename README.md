# Facial_recognition_using_siamese_model
This project is based on face recognition, which identifies our face if we give any other face it will predict as not verified, this is implemented by cnn based neural network, i tried to copy the siamese model architecture in which we train the neural network with two input of images one with correct and wrong images with label as 0 and another one with correct and correct images with label as 1, so our neural network will try to train the model which can identify and check the similarity between images, so that at last we can use this model as a face recognition, for example after training this model, in one file we can save the authorized face images of yourself and our friends and we can send that whole pictures one by one with the newly detecting face image so now this trainied model with predict the labels and scores which we can use and detect it is a authorised face or not.
